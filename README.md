 ## HOW TO PLAY

 You can move your astronaut in two ways:

 - **Drag and release**: If you drag from your astronaut and release far from him, you will make him fly through space (like a slingshot or angry birds).
 - **Tap when orbiting**: If you are orbiting a planet, tap anywhere on screen for you astronaut to fly away on the direction it is currently on.

 - Note: Created by *Rodrigo Longhi Guimar√£es*. This playground is meant to be used in XCode or in iPad Playgrounds in portrait mode.
