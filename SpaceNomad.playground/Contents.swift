 # Space Nomad - An Exploration Game

 This is a simple experience where you control your character around the galaxy and fly through planets.
 
 There is no objective, so enjoy your time!
 
 ---
 
 ## HOW TO PLAY
 
 You can move your astronaut in two ways:
 
 - **Drag and release**: If you drag from your astronaut and release far from him, you will make him fly through space (like a slingshot or angry birds).
 - **Tap when orbiting**: If you are orbiting a planet, tap anywhere on screen for you astronaut to fly away on the direction it is currently on.
 
 - Note: Created by *Rodrigo Longhi Guimar√£es*. This playground is meant to be used in XCode or in iPad Playgrounds in portrait mode.
